import turtle               # allows us to use the turtles library

wn = turtle.Screen()        # creates a graphics window
alex = turtle.Turtle()      # create a turtle named alex
alex.forward(150)           # tell alex to move forward by 150 units
alex.left(90)               # turn by 90 degrees
alex.forward(75)            # complete the second side of a rectangle

turtle.exitonclick()        # wait for a button click, then close window
